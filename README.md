# Gemini Translate

A lightweight browser extension that translates text in input fields (e.g., textboxes, textareas, and contenteditable elements) using either a mock translation for testing or real API calls in production. The extension replaces the original text with the translated version upon clicking the translation icon or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+/).

üöß **This project is still in development and has not been officially released. Once published, you will be able to install it easily from your browser's extension store.**
